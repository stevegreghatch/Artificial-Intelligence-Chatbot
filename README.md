# Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Task-1-Chatbot

INTRODUCTION

In this task, you will use the Pandorabot environment to create a conversational agent for the given scenario. Your chatbot will interact with students who are about to graduate. You will document the development of the chatbot and investigate the best calibration approaches and AI optimization methods that support the chatbot in having the required functionalities in the most efficient way.

SCENARIO

You are a career advisor working for a university that offers many degrees, including a degree in computer science. You know that there is a vast range of computing jobs and that students who are about to graduate are generally aware of their disciplinary preferences and personal strengths. The enrollment of computer science students at your university has been increasing and you can no longer meet with each of them individually to give career guidance. During a meeting of career advisors, your manager suggests that you develop a chatbot that may reduce your workload and interact with students to help them identify jobs in computing fields for which they are qualified.

You have been asked to identify five job types that require an undergraduate degree in computer science and to construct a chatbot in the Pandorabot environment. The chatbot will interact with individual students, help them identify their strengths and preferences, and help them decide which career options to consider.

    REQUIREMENTS

    A.  Explain the functionalities of the chatbot and how they will meet the needs described in the scenario.

    B.  Identify five computing job types that your chatbot can recommend based on student interaction with the chatbot.

    C.  Provide the generated chatbot code files to support the five identified job types from part B.

    D.  Explain how the chatbot training cases were selected and how you used artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) to enhance the functionality of the chatbot. Provide examples of the chatbotâ€™s functionality that represent the selected cases at the end of the training process in support of your explanation.

    E.  Create an installation manual for the chatbot that includes the web link to access the live chatbot in the Pandorabot platform.

    F.  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot development environment and explain how they supported or impeded the construction of the chatbot.

    G.  Explain how the chatbot will be monitored and maintained to improve the final user experience.

    H.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a verbal summary of the capabilities of your chatbot and an example of human interaction with the chatbot in which it provides meaningful career advice.
