# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Chatbot - AIML

WGU C951 - Performance Assessment - Task 1

SCENARIO

You are a career advisor working for a university that offers many degrees, including a degree in computer science. You know that there is a vast range of computing jobs and that students who are about to graduate are generally aware of their disciplinary preferences and personal strengths. The enrollment of computer science students at your university has been increasing and you can no longer meet with each of them individually to give career guidance. During a meeting of career advisors, your manager suggests that you develop a chatbot that may reduce your workload and interact with students to help them identify jobs in computing fields for which they are qualified.

You have been asked to identify five job types that require an undergraduate degree in computer science and to construct a chatbot in the Pandorabot environment. The chatbot will interact with individual students, help them identify their strengths and preferences, and help them decide which career options to consider.
